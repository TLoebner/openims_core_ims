<section><title>Authorization implementation</title>
<para>Authorization is one of key elements within presence server. PA module
supports only XCAP authorization now.</para>
<para>Internal subscriptions may use default settings only (XCAP root, XCAP
parameters) which is insufficient! Can we use separate route in config to
set this? Or manipulate directly with XCAP module data members/functions for
setting them?
</para>

<para>We will use <quote>delayed authorization</quote> from now. When is the
presentity created, authorization rules are empty and they are asynchronously
requested from XCAP. As soon as they arrive all watchers for presentity are
reauthorized. Authorization rules are checked after some amount of time
according to settings (this eliminates need of notification changes from XCAP
for now).</para>
