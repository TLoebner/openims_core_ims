2006-01-12
	* updated module documentation

2006-12-14
	* corrected typing error in column name
	* corrected bug - tuple extensions were not stored into database
	* corrected XMLRPC - after changes in xmlrpc module CDATA sections didn't
	work as before and had to be thrown out

2006-12-13
	* database column names are stored in variables and configurable via
	module parameters

2006-12-07
	* updated doc to be compilable standalone

2006-11-06
	* bug correction - noninitialized variable in ask_auth_rules and added
	return code from xcap_get_pres_rules verification - reported and patched
	by Bogdan

2006-04-09
	* corrected bug (failed prepare_notify in handle_new_subscription caused
	watcher destroying but he wasn't removed from presentity's watcher list)

2006-03-09
	* updated DB manipulation functions

2006-07-26
	* first step for PIDF extensions support (storing/loading into/from DB not
	finished yet)

2006-07-24
	* litle xcap_params optimization (allocation together with parent
	structure)

2006-07-21
	* watcher lists replaced by double linked lists (better for remove)
	* db schema updates

2006-07-20
	* get_presentity_uid doesn't allocate memory
	* removed db_update_presentity (only one - ineffective - call replaced by
	call to db_update_presence_tuple)
	* improved process_tuple_change - two possible DB updates reduced to one
	* clarified add_watcher/remove_watcher functions
	* removed notify_all_watchers, notify_all_winfo_watchers (not called)
	* removed common.h (function str_append was moved into CDS library is it
	needed?)

2006-07-19
	* splitted code from presentity.c and presentity.h into smaller pieces
	(pres_timer.c/h, tuple.c/h, ...)
	* finished structures rewriting (joined PA structures with structures
	from presence library -> no translations between them for presence doc
	creation)

2006-07-12
	* improved and tested dialog refreshing (contacts in NOTIFY responses and
	renewal SUBSCRIBE requests)
	* ??? PA structures contains common presence structures

2006-07-10
	* added parameter async_auth_queries for switching between sync/async
	loading of auth rules (synchronous dowload is done from inside of critical
	section locked by pdomain mutext, which is not good for performance)
	* added parameter max_auth_requests_per_tick for async. auth queries
	* added parameter auth_rules_refresh_time for control how often are auth.
	rules refreshed (we have no "XCAP change" notifications) - it could be
	better than refresh on resubscription (criticised)

2006-07-07
	* asynchronous loading of authorization rules (better response than
	synchronous)

2006-07-04
	* removed unused parts from code (old which were rewritten; location
	related which need to be completely rewritten; resource lists which are
	better in RLS module)
	* cosmetical changes

2006-07-03
	* improved handling new subscription - most work moved outside of critical
	secion

2006-06-30
	* added short description of state aggregation

2006-06-29
	* rearranged work with mimetypes
	* cleaned code of PA:
		- less tests - most left on parse_hfs and check_message
		- separated handling renewal and new subscription (better
		performance?)
		- removed location stuff

2006-05-25
	* added Max-Forwards header into NOTIFY requests

2006-05-15
	* added reaction on failed NOTIFY into non-winfo subscriptions
	* added parameter ignore_408_on_notify

2006-05-10
	* corrected bug in PUBLISH handling (refreshing state with empty body
	destroyed notes and person elements and did not store tuples into DB)
	* corrected RPC function pa.publish (accepts empty file for status
	refreshes)

2006-05-09
	* removed unused parameter xcap_root

2006-04-20
	* added uid and uri into error log for "resubscription to nonexisting
	presentity"
	* rpc_trace doesn't put empty strings as separators (more readable using
	new serctl)

2006-04-18
	* added profiling

2006-04-13
	* added parameters subscribe_to_users and pa_subscription_uri (prepared
	for subscriptions to clients)

2006-04-12
	* added missing parsing From header into message authorization function

2006-04-11
	* changed QSA (reduced memory allocations)
	* changed parameter of "authorize_message" function (filename with
	im-rules instead of XCAP root)

2006-04-10
	* changed QSA - corrected content-type propagation

2006-04-07
	* added function check_subscription_status and removed AVP operations due
	to problems with them (after sending NOTIFY in handle_subscription are
	AVPs lost!)
	* store_offline_winfo and check_subscription_status uses global variable
	with last subscription status instead of AVP (see above)
	* added parameter pres_rules_file which specifies filename used in XCAP
	queries instead of default presence-rules.xml

2006-04-06
	* xcap queries moved into xcap module

2006-04-04
	* sending empty string in NOTIFY bodies - TCP requires content-length and
	if sending message with NULL body, it is not set
	* handle_subscription sets AVP subscription_status (pending, terminated,
	error)
	* store_offline_winfo stores status from AVP subscription_status

2006-04-03
	* function for server contact extraction was moved into common libraries
	(it is used by RLS too)

2006-03-29
	* added function for MESSAGE authorization

2006-03-28
	* added parameter max_publish_expiration (max time for expiration of
	information published via PUBLISH request)

2006-03-27
	* added (empty) function for message authorization
	* corrected bug in offline watcherinfo dumping (removed were messages with
	id less or equal than requested instead of equal only)

2006-03-23
	* added debugging messages into send_winfo_notify due to problems with
	messages (Long UDP messages are sometimes ignored by clients; sometimes
	are too big to be sent. But there are problems with TCP too!)

2006-03-22
	* using get_content_length instead of strlen(body)

2006-03-21
	* flag (PFLAG_WATCHERINFO_CHANGED, WFLAG_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGED) settings in
	internals, not in handle_subscription
	* sets subscription status for internal subscriptions (QSA)

2006-03-20
	* setting flag PFLAG_WATCHERINFO_CHANGED only for new subscriptions
	because we don't send expiration in watcherinfo documents and thus it is
	only "spamming" if we send watcherinfo for resubscriptions too

2006-03-17
	* changed XCAP query parameters

2006-03-02
	* improved robustness of libs (CDS, presence) and PA
	* cosmetical changes

2006-03-01
	* corrected BUG - Contact was sent in 200 response, now in all 2xx
	responses
	* cleaning WFLAG_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGED after notification sent (in
	handle_subscription)
	* small cosmetical and robustness improving changes

2006-02-28
	* call to timer_presentity in handle_subscription replaced by call to
	send_notify and remove_watcher_if_expired (i.e. sending notification to
	all watchers immediately -> sending notification to new/updated watcher)

2006-02-27
	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-15
	* RPC function pa.publish uses UID instead of uri!
	* XCAP uris for authorization documents contain UID instead of username!
	* added configurable max_subscription_expiration (undocumented)

2006-02-14
	* added parameter for disabling processing internal subscriptions

2006-02-02
	* added handling of <person> element from RPID (whole <person> elements
	are stored and put into NOTIFY messages; they are not processed in any
	way due to its complexity - see the rpid draft) => this will be changed 
	to process ALL unknown elements from PIDF documents
	* improved documentation (offline winfo, parameters, ...)

2006-02-01
	* added functions for storing offline auth. info (store_winfo and
	dump_stored_winfo) into database [they don't work in memory],
	documentation will be added soon

2006-01-30
	* added function target_online
	* added parameter use_callbacks (int) - [if set to 0, no callback are
	used]
	* corrected handle_publish - returns 4xx for unsupported events instead of
	OK
