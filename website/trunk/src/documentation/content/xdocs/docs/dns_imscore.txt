This FAQ is a living document which became necessary after
having answered lots of questions on DNS at OpenIMSCore mailing
lists. The aim of this document is to help the IMS-Software User 
with the settings.  Unfortunately our target is not to teach the 
DNS-Mechanism.  So take that into account please as you read this
white paper. You can contact for more Information dragos.vingarzan
