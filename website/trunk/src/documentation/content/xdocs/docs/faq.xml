      <ul>
      	<li><strong>I tried the SVN URLs on berliOS but I gen an error.</strong><br/>
      		berliOS uses a template for indicating the SVN URLs. As we have more than 1 sub-project, please use the links indicated 
      		<a href="sources/index.html">here</a>.
      	</li>
      	<li><strong>I want to commit something, but I don't have right access.</strong><br/>
      		In order to keep a high quality for the code, only a limited number of maintainers have modification permissions. Each is 
      		responsible	for checking if new patches work properly and for the administration of the sub-projects. Please post your 
      		patches to the mailing-lists and they will be checked and applied. If you are an active contributor and you demonstrate
      		that your patches can be trusted, we will add you as a project maintainer.
      	</li>
      	<li><strong>OK, but what if I want to make a big change and would require a branch?</strong><br/>
      		Then you will get this access sooner. You will just have to convince one of the maintainers that your branch makes sense.
      	</li>
      	<li><strong>Can I contribute with another IMS component that I am working on?</strong><br/>
      		You are most welcomed. Just let us know and we will import it in the SVN.

      <ul>
      	<li><strong>I get an error that "setkey" is not found when starting the P-CSCF. How do I fix it?</strong><br/>
      		Install the ipsec-tools. "setkey" is included there and it is used to set-up the IPSec Security Associations. Also, don't
      		forget to check if you IPSec AH and ESP compiled in your kernel.
      	</li>
      	<li><strong>How do I enable the RTP Proxy?</strong><br/>
      		Download and install RTPProxy. You can get it from <a href="http://www.iptel.org/downloads">http://www.iptel.org/downloads</a>.
      		Then start it with the following commandline:
      		<source>rtpproxy -l 1.2.3.4 -s udp:127.0.0.1:34999 -f</source>
      		Edit the pcscf.cfg and enable the RTPProxy:
      		<source>modparam("pcscf","rtpproxy_enable", 1)</source>      		
      	</li>

      <ul>
      	<li><strong>Is there a free IMS Client?</strong><br/>
      		Unfortunately we don't know of any. Our OpenIC is available only commercially 
      	(Contact: <a href="mailto:info@open-ims.org?subject=OpenIC%20request">info@open-ims.org</a>).</li>
      	<li><strong>Then how can one test the core?</strong><br/>
      		We are sharing also the SIP-to-IMS Gateway and you could use a SIP client. Or use 
      	<a href="http://sipp.sourceforge.net/">SIPp</a>, which has support even for AKA and media</li>
      	<li><strong>I am using SIP client X and it does not work. What could be wrong?</strong><br/>
      		We know that for example 
      		<a href="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">Ekiga</a> does not comply with the Digest authentication RFC and is unusable. Some
      		other clients might have problems. Please let us know if you encounter such a case so that we could either solve the issue
      		or post it here. Before you do that, please check that you have configured in correctly as indicated 
      		<a href="/docs/install.html#step7">here</a>.
