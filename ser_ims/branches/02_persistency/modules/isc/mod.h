 *  
 * \section isc_overview Overview
 * 
 * This module is supposed to provide support for the ISC interface between the 
 * Serving-CSCF and the Aplication Servers 
 * 
 * To use you need the \ref SCSCF loaded. This is because this module uses the registrar
 * in there for Initial Filter Criteria storage.
 * 
 * 
 * \section isc_code Code Structure
 * The functionality exported to the SER routing script is defined in mod.c . The IFC
 * checking logic is in checker.c. isc.c defines the ISC interface processing and mark.c 
 * the message marking mechanism. For generic SIP processing functions look into sip.c.
 * 
 * \section isc_config Configuration and usage
 * 
 * For exported functions look at #isc_cmds.\n
 * For configuration parameters look at #isc_params.\n 
 * 
 * 
 * The messages forwarded to the Application Server have the following marking:
\code
Route: <AS>, <sip:ifcmark@[isc_my_uri];lr;s=xxx;h=xxx;d=xxx>
\endcode
 * The message is "loose-routed" to the AS. If the AS responds with a request, the 2nd
 * route header value will contain all the required state information for identification 
 * and IFC matching resume.
 * 
 * For detailed information on marking take a look at mark.c.
 * 
 * 
 * To check if a message is matching the next unchecked IFC you should do the following for
 * checking triggers for the originating user:
 * \code
{  
    ...
	if (ISC_match_filter("orig")){
		t_on_reply("ISC_Orig_reply");
        t_on_failure("ISC_Orig_failure");
		# here the message matched and was forwarded to the AS already and we can exit
        exit;
    }
    # here the message did not match any (more) IFCs
    ...
}    
 \endcode
 * Then to catch a response:		  
 \code
onreply_route[ISC_Orig_reply]
{
    log(1,">>       ISC_Orig_reply\n");
    #if you would like to do some processing on responses from AS, do it here
    break;
}

failure_route[ISC_Orig_failure]
{
    log(1,">>       ISC_Orig_failure\n");
    if (!t_check_status("408")){ 
        #if you would like to do some processing on responses from AS, do it here   
        break;
    }
    if (ISC_is_session_continued()){
		#here the AS failed to respond and we should continue processing 
        break;      
    }else{
    	#here the AS failed to respond and the session should be terminated
        t_reply("555","AS failed to respond");
    }
}
\endcode
 *
 * Or, if the AS responded with the request modified, or with another request and
 * it wishes to resume the IFC triggering session, the following should be applied to
 * identify this case:
\code
	...
	if (ISC_from_AS("orig")){
		#do resume of processing - probably call ISC_match_filter("orig")
	}
	...
\endcode	
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * \section isc_example Example
 * And here is a real usage example:
 * - Serving-CSCF configuration file with ISC support \include scscf.cfg
 *
