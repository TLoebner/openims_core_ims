<para>Module for doing XCAP queries.</para>

<para>This module covers functions called internaly to access XCAP server. These
functions were separated into standalone module to allow simple replacing XCAP
queries with queries into database or local filesystem or whatever else.  Next
reason was to protect other modules from linking with libcurl (implements
HTTP) or other such stuff.
