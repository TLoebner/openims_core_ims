<!-- <h1>The Open IMS Core JavaDiameterPeer</h1> -->
Documentation for Open IMS Core HSS Implementation.

<h1>Overview</h1>
This HSS provides a java based implementation of a 3GPP IMS HSS.

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>
The HSS implementation consists of two parts.

The definition of the required interfaces and Java classes for the Cx, Sh
and Zh interface and the implementation of these interfaces.

</p>
<p>
You can find four packages containing the mentioned classes:
<ul>
<li><a href="de/fhg/fokus/cx/package-summary.html">Cx - The definition of Cx interfaces</a></li>
<li><a href="de/fhg/fokus/sh/package-summary.html">Sh - The definition of Sh interfaces</a></li>
<li><a href="de/fhg/fokus/zh/package-summary.html">Zh - The definition of Zh interfaces</a></li>
<li><a href="de/fhg/fokus/hss/package-summary.html">Hss - The implementation of the interfaces above</a></li>
</ul>

  <dd>It has to be noted that this 
      <font color=red><b> Open Source IMS Core System is not intended to become 
      or act as a product in a commercial context!</b></font> Its sole purpose 
      is to provide an IMS core reference implementation for IMS technology 
      testing and IMS application prototyping for research purposes, typically 
      performed in IMS test-beds.
      <p>
      Users of the Open Source IMS Core System have to be aware that IMS 
      technology may be subject of patents and license terms, as being specified 
      within the various IMS-related IETF, ITU-T, ETSI, and 3GPP standards. Thus 
      all Open IMS Core users have to take notice of this fact and have to agree 
      to check out carefully before installing, using and extending the Open 
      Source IMS Core System, if related patents and licenses may become 
      applicable to the intended usage context.
