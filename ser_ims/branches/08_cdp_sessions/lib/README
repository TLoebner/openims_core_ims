Standalone libraries:
---------------------

binrpc - A library that provides common interface for different communication
         methods (UNIX sockets, TCP, UDP) using binary RPC as a transport form 
         of data. The interface is documented directly in binrpc_api.h file and 
         can by generated into HTML form by using Doxygen. There is no 
         difference between compilation "with" or "without" SER (see compilation
         section below).

Libraries common to modules:
---------------------------

cds - Common Data Structures (basic string operations, dynamic string,
      vector, message queue, ...)

presence - Library holding common structures and functions abaut presence
           (API for internal subscriptions, common presence structures,
           common presence data formats)
           requires internal libraries: cds

xcap - Common XCAP operations and structures (XCAP authorization documents
       and XCAP resource lists processing)
       requires external libraries: libxml2, libcurl3 (nonSER version)
       requires internal libraries: cds

Used by modules: pa, rls, dialog, rpa

Usage:
-----

All libraries can be compiled "with ser" or "without ser". Compilation
without ser may be useful for debugging purposes or for example for 
searching for memory leaks with some tool like valgrind.

Compilation with ser:
--------------------

Compilation and installation of these libraries is NOT DONE by running
main ser makefile now - it MUST be done MANUALLY. For this purpose
is there Makefile.ser. To compile and install libraries simply run

   make -f Makefile.ser install

in lib directory. You can select destination directory like in the case
of ser, for example:

   make -f Makefile.ser install prefix="/my/ser/directory"
   
AFTER COMPILATION of libraries you can COMPILE MODULES using this 
libraries like PA, RLS or dialog.


Running with ser (Linux):
----------------

The path to installed libraries must be known to linker on startup. This
can be done by setting variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running ser. For
example, if libraries were installed to default directory (/usr/local),
you should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ser. In the case of 
nonstandard installation, you can use something like 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/ser/directory/lib/ser.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation for all libraries is (or will be) in 
docbook-XML format and it is stored in doc directory (for example cds/doc 
contains documentation for Common Data Structures library).

Documentation can be translated into HTML using a XSLT processor
which is able to work with "include" directives.
For example
   xmlto html cds/doc/cds.xml
will create HTML documentation for CDS library in current directory.
