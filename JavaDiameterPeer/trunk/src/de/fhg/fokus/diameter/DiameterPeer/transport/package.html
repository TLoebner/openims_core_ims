Contains acceptors and communicators for creating and maintaining connections 
between Diameter peers.

<p>
A DiameterPeer uses an Acceptor to listen to requests from other DiameterPeers. 
If a request is coming in from an undetected DiameterPeer, a Communicator is 
created to maintain this connection. This Communicator will also be associated 
with a Peer in the PeerManager.
