	* corrected memory leak

2006-07-12
	* improved dialog refreshing

2006-06-13
	* few common functions moved into cds/sip_utils

2006-06-06
	* corrected BUG reported by Luis Silva - added missing call to
	parse_from_header

2006-05-25
	* added Max-Forwards header into SUBSCRIBE requests
	* removed unnecessary TM/DIALOG binding function call in module
	initialization

2006-04-27
	* added parameter for delayed sending of SUBSCRIBE requests
	(max_subscribe_delay)

2006-04-21
	* added parameter presence_outbound_proxy (may be used instead of
	presence_route or both together) - presence subscriptions are sent there
	if set

2006-04-11
	* changed QSA (reduced memory allocations)

2006-04-10
	* changed QSA - corrected content-type propagation
	* added parameter additional_presence_headers which holds additional
	headers put into SUBSCRIBE requests for presence events

2006-04-04

	if sending message with NULL body, it is not set

2006-03-22
	* using get_content_length instead of strlen(body)
	* added "Content-Length: 0" into outgoing SUBSCRIBE requests (such message
	is otherwise not parsed by SER when using TCP transport)

	* subscription status propagation through QSA

2006-03-17
	* trace function not writing into file (was due to memory leaks in fifo)
