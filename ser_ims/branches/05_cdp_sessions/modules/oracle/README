Dependencies
------------

The following binaries were used during the development and testing:

instantclient-basic-linux32-10.1.0.4-20050525.zip
instantclient-sdk-linux32-10.1.0.4-20050525.zip

WARNING! 10.2.0.1 version is unstable, and is not recommended for Debian Linux.

(You do not need to install 'sdk' package if using binary SER distribution.)

instantclient-sqlplus-linux32-10.1.0.4-20050525.zip
might be required in future for automated creation of SER DB.

The packages could be downloaded from "Downloads" section of www.oracle.com
web site. (You'll be asked to register first.)

Unzip the contents of the packages to /usr/local and make /usr/local/instantclient
symbolic link to the created folder. Also make the following  symlink:
libclntsh.so -> libclntsh.so.10.1.


Core sources patching
---------------------

Recompile SER with the following macros added to the proper part of Makefile.defs
below "#os specific stuff":

DEFS += -DLINUX -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_REENTRANT
LIBS += -lpthread

I took them from Makefile example of the instantclient SDK.
(Probably, -DLINUX could be omitted.)

There were some warnings about redefinition of _XOPEN_SOURCE,
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, and __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED macros inside
daemonize.c. So, I protected them with '#ifndef _XOPEN_SOURCE'
condition.


Getting started from command line
---------------------------------

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/ser
cvs -z4 co -r rel_0_9_0 experimental/oracle
cvs -z4 co -r rel_0_9_0 sip_router
cp -a experimental/oracle sip_router/modules/
# download instantclient archives to $HOME as described above, then:
sudo unzip $HOME/instantclient-sdk-linux32-10.1.0.5-20060511.zip -d /usr/local
sudo unzip $HOME/instantclient-basic-linux32-10.1.0.5-20060511.zip -d /usr/local
sudo ln -s libclntsh.so.10.1 /usr/local/instantclient10_1/libclntsh.so
sudo ln -s instantclient10_1 /usr/local/instantclient
cd sip_router
# patch Makefile.defs and daemonize.c as described above, then:
make modules=modules/oracle modules


Usage
-----

For basic SER set up add/change the following lines to your ser.cfg:

  fifo_db_url="oracle://username:passwd@/ser"

  loadmodule "/path/to/ser/lib/ser/modules/oracle.so"

  modparam("usrloc", "db_url", "oracle://username:passwd@/ser")
  modparam("auth_db", "db_url", "oracle://username:passwd@/ser")

Additional SER modules may require similar changes to ser.cfg.
See documentation for corresponding modules.
 

db_url format: "oracle://username:password@/dbname"

Additional parameters are taken from tnsnames.ora file which must be located
inside $TNS_ADMIN folder.

Example contents of tnsnames.ora:

 -- begin --
SER =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <your.db.host.com>)(PORT = <port>))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = <sevice.name.com>)
    )
  )
 -- end --

Example 'version' table schema (NUMBER precision is important!):

 -- begin --
 Name                                      Null?    Type
 ----------------------------------------- -------- ----------------------------
 TABLE_NAME                                NOT NULL VARCHAR2(64)
 TABLE_VERSION                             NOT NULL NUMBER(5)
 -- end --


Implementation
--------------

OCI API is utilized. It is recommended to use Oracle Instant Client package.

db_raw_query() is not implemented.


TODO
----

 - commit patch for core sources
 - poorly tested with respect to call stress-load.
 - insert will fail if more than single date is inserted.
 - BLOBs are limited to 4000 bytes, and untested.
 - returned column names are not filled with proper data.
 - timezone related stuff should be reviewed
 - Review why checks for NULL argument to pkg_free() are required?
 - remove const prefix from db_val_t:val.string_val
 - yet not robust against hackish parameters.
 - use pool of connections, (like in mysql?)
 - additional TODOs are marked with XXX throughout the code.
