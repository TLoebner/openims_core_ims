How to install OpenIMSCore with Emergency Services support
==========================================================

Description:
------------
There are two new entities, besides the normal IMS Core: the E-CSCF (Emergency CSCF) and the LRF (Location Retrieval Function).
The LRF node will need an external LoST server (RFC 5222).

Instalation:
------------
In order to install the CSCFs and the HSS follow the same steps as in the instalation 
guide from http://www.openimscore.org/installation_guide, with the single modification:
in the step 2 (Get the Source Code) instead of
"svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openimscore/ser_ims/trunk ser_ims"
use
"svn checkout http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openimscore/ser_ims/branches/12_em_services ser_ims"

Download the LoST server and prerequisits:
------------------------------------------
If no LoST server is installed, the default PSAP URI configured in the LRF will be used:
lrf.cfg: modparam("lrf","default_psap","default_psap_SIP_URI"), the default_psap_SIP_URI can be for example sip:psap@open-ims.test after creating the new user for the psap (see the section "Using sipp" c2) subsection ).

If you want to use a LoST server read the follwing informations.

a)Download and install tomcat as on the site: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MMBase-Inst-HOWTO/x321.html. If you install it from a root user, for example using apt-get install on Ubuntu, you will get errors when a client will send requests, because the LoST server application might not have write access to create a new TCP connection. So just to be on the safe side, install it as a normal user on your maschine.

b)Download the LoST server (implemented as a tomcat application) and database from the download page of the site: http://honamsun.cs.columbia.edu/lost_homepage/.

Configuring the LoST server
-----------------------------
You must configure it before installing, so that the application is copied in the right tomcat folder and running on the wanted path and port.
The LoST server must not interfere with the HSS server, running by default on the localhost on the port 8080. 

a)The port can be configured from the tomcat in the file tomcat/conf/server.xml: Connector port. 
For example: <Connector port="8180" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443"/>

b)The tomcat folder must be set in the lost-server-1.0.0/build.xml. 
For example: <property name="catalina.home" value="/usr/local/tomcat"/> 

c)To configure the path the LoST servlet will use you must modify the file lost-server-1.0.0/web/WEB-INF/web.xml.
By default the path is "LoSTServlet".

Do not forget to copy the jars postgresql-jdbc4.jar and servlet-api.jar in a lib directory from the tomcat folder. (see lost-server-1.0.0/README)

Configure the LRF to refer the LoST server
------------------------------------------
The default url of the LoST server in the LRF is "http://lost.open-ims.test:8180/lost/LoSTServlet".
In the default configuration of the IMS Core, lost.open-ims.test is resolved as localhost. 
(see http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore/ser_ims/branches/12_em_services/cfg/open-ims.dnszone)
If you want to use a different url for the LoST server you must configure: it, tomcat and the LRF according.
To configure the LRF you must set it in the lrf.cfg, for example:
modparam("lrf","lost_server","http://lost.open-ims.test:8180/lost/LoSTServlet")

!!! If you are using a different LoST server please make sure that is not running on the same IP and port as the HSS 
and modify the lrf.cfg to set the LoST server url accordingly.

Installing the database:
------------------------
For how to create the database see lost-db-1.0.0/README. 
The database will contain mapping information for the location from the generated emergency INVITE.

Unfortunately the SIP URI that will be mapped to the location informations are from the domain irt.cs.columbia.edu. For example psap_nj@irt.cs.columbia.edu.
This are bogus users. You can modify the scripts containing the data to use users from the open-ims.test domain, using the sed tool (see http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-1).
You must modify civic_us.sql and geo_us.sql
sed s/"irt.cs.columbia.edu"/"open-ims.test"/ civic_us.sql > new_civic_us.sql
sed s/"irt.cs.columbia.edu"/"open-ims.test"/ geo_us.sql > new_geo_us.sql

Now you must use these files to create the databases.

$mv new_civic_us.sql civic_us.sql
$mv new_geo_us.sql geo_us.sql

Verify that the user and name of the database from the create_db.sh, create_as.sh and create_resoler.sh are the same you are using in the LoST server, or that the user from the LoST server has been granted SELECT access to the database.
You can now run the scripts: create_db.sh, create_as.sh and create_resoler.sh to create the Postgres database for the LoST server.

Configure the LoST server for the Postgres database link
--------------------------------------------------------
Read lost-server-1.0.0/README.
To adjust the type of connection (pooling or not) you have to modify the lost.properties file, that can be found in lost-1.0.0/src/, 
the lost-server README is errornous on the filepath of lost.properties. 

Starting the components
-----------------------
For starting the components, follow the same guide, step 6, but start also the LoST server (tomcat and postgres daemons), ecscf.sh and lrf.sh.

How to create and end an emergency call
--------------------------------------

Using sipp
******************
a) 	download the newest sipp stable version (http://sipp.sourceforge.net)
	compile it with MD5 authentication support as in the guide: http://sipp.sourceforge.net/doc/reference.html#SIP+authentication
	install sipp (http://sipp.sourceforge.net/doc3.0/reference.html)

b) Modify the scripts for the S-SCSCF (file cfg/scscf.cfg)
set the default authentication algorithm to MD5
-> modparam("scscf","registration_default_algorithm","MD5")
set the qop parameter to ""
->modparam("scscf","registration_qop","")

c) Run the sipp scenarios
	$cd ser_ims/test/emerg_serv/

c1) If a LoST server is properly configured and running (including the modification of the LoST database to refer to the open-ims.test domain), 

	sip:alice@open-ims.test as the Emergency Services client's SIP URI and sip:psap_nj@open-ims.test as the PSAP's SIP URI:
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* create the user with the URI sip:psap_nj@open-ims.test
		$cd ser_ims/cfg
		$./add-imscore-user_newdb.sh -u psap_nj -t tel:112 -a
	* make sure that the "using_lost_srv" parameter in the lrf.cfg is set to "1"
		modparam("lrf","using_lost_srv","1")
	* set the url of the LoST server in the lrf.cfg
	* start all the components (P/I/S/E-CSCF, HSS, LoST server, LRF) in parallel
	* PSAP registeres as normal IMS registration
	$sipp -sf non_em_psap_nj.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3062 -m 1

	* Alice registeres as emergency IMS registration
	$sipp -sf em_reg_alice.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3061 -m 1

	* PSAP waits for the call (UAS)
	$sipp -sf uas_a2psap_nj.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3062 -m 1

	* Alice creates and ends an emergency call (UAC)
	$sipp -sf em_uac_a2b.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3061 -m 1

c2) If no LoST server: using a default PSAP URI, no new user in the HSS databases needed

	c2.1) Alice acting as the Emergency Services client and Bob as the PSAP:
	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* set "using_lost_srv" parameter  in the lrf.cfg to "0", default value is "1" 
		modparam("lrf","using_lost_srv","0")
	* set the default psap_uri in the ecscf.cfg as 
		modparam("lrf","default_psap","sip:bob@open-ims.test")
	* start the components : P/I/S/E-CSCF, HSS, LRF in parallel
	* Bob registeres as normal IMS registration
	$sipp -sf non_em_reg_bob.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3062 -m 1

	* Alice registeres as emergency IMS registration
	$sipp -sf em_reg_alice.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3061 -m 1

	* Bob waits for the call (UAS)
	$sipp -sf uas_a2b.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3062 -m 1

	* Alice creates and ends an emergency call (UAC)
	$sipp -sf em_uac_a2b.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3061 -m 1


	c2.2) Bob acting as the Emergency Services client and Alice as the PSAP:

		modparam("lrf","using_lost_srv","0")
	* set the default psap_uri in the lrf.cfg as sip:alice@open-ims.test
		modparam("lrf","default_psap","sip:alice@open-ims.test")
	* start the components : P/I/S/E-CSCF, HSS, LRF in parallel
	* Alice registeres as normal IMS registration
	$sipp -sf em_reg_bob.xml 127.0.0.1:4060 -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3062 -m 1
