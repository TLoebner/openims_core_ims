Overview

 The destination blacklist (dst_blacklist) is used to try to mark bad
  destination and avoid possible future expensive send operation to them.
 A destination is added to the blacklist when trying to send to it fails (e.g.
 timeout while trying to send or connect on tcp), or when a sip timeout occurs
 while trying to forward statefully an invite (using tm) and the remote side
 doesn't send back any response.
 The blacklist (if enabled) is checked before any send attempt.


Drawbacks


 Using the destination blacklist will cause some performance degradation,
 especially on multi cpu machines. If you don't need it you can easily
  disable it, either in ser's config or at compile time. Disabling it at
  compile time is slightly better (but not in a "measurable" way) then
   disabling it at runtime, from the config file.
 Whether the destination blacklist is better to be on or off depends a lot
  on the setup. In general is better to turn it on when:
   - sending to clients that don't respond is expensive (e.g. lots of clients
   use tcp and they have the habit of silently discarding tcp traffic from time
   to time)
   - statefull forwarding is used (tm) and lower memory usage is desired
   (a transaction will fail immediately if the destination is already 
   blacklisted by a previous transaction to the same destination that failed
   due to timeout)
   - faster dns failover is desired, especially when statefull forwarding (tm)
   and udp are used
   - better chances of DOS survival are important


Config Variables

 use_dst_blacklist = on | off (default off) - enable the destination blacklist:
  if on each failed send attempt will cause the destination to be blacklisted.
  Before any send this blacklist will be checked and if a match is found the
  send is no longer attempted (an error is returned immediately).
  Note: using the blacklist incurs a small performance penalty.

 dst_blacklist_mem = size in Kb (default 250 Kb) - maximum
  shared memory amount used for keeping the blacklisted destinations.

 dst_blacklist_expire = time in s (default 60 s) - how much time a 
  blacklisted destination will be kept in the blacklist (w/o any update).

 dst_blacklist_gc_interval = time in s (default 60 s) - how often the 
  garbage collection will run (eliminating old, expired entries).


Compile Options

 USE_DST_BLACKLIST - if defined the blacklist support will be compiled-in
  (default).


 Note: To remove a compile options,  edit ser's Makefile.defs and remove it 
   form DEFS list. To add a compile options add it to the make command line,
     e.g.: make proper; make all extra_defs=-DUSE_DNS_FAILOVER
   or for a permanent solution, edit Makefile.defs and add it to DEFS 
   (don't forget to prefix it with -D).
