/* 
  timer.c is where we implement TM timers. It has been designed
  for high performance using some techniques of which timer users
  need to be aware.

	One technique is "fixed-timer-length". We maintain separate 
	timer lists, all of them include elements of the same time
	to fire. That allows *appending* new events to the list as
	opposed to inserting them by time, which is costly due to
	searching time spent in a mutex. The performance benefit is
	noticeable. The limitation is you need a new timer list for
	each new timer length.

	Another technique is the timer process slices off expired elements
	from the list in a mutex, but executes the timer after the mutex
	is left. That saves time greatly as whichever process wants to
	add/remove a timer, it does not have to wait until the current
	list is processed. However, be aware the timers may hit in a delayed
	manner; you have no guarantee in your process that after resetting a timer, 
	it will no more hit. It might have been removed by timer process,
    and is waiting to be executed.  The following example shows it:

			PROCESS1				TIMER PROCESS

	0.								timer hits, it is removed from queue and
									about to be executed
	1.	process1 decides to
		reset the timer 
	2.								timer is executed now
	3.	if the process1 naively
		thinks the timer could not 
		have been executed after 
		resetting the timer, it is
		WRONG -- it was (step 2.)

	So be careful when writing the timer handlers. Currently defined timers 
	don't hurt if they hit delayed, I hope at least. Retransmission timer 
	may results in a useless retransmission -- not too bad. FR timer not too
	bad either as timer processing uses a REPLY mutex making it safe to other
	processing affecting transaction state. Wait timer not bad either -- processes
	putting a transaction on wait don't do anything with it anymore.

		Example when it does not hurt:

			P1						TIMER
	0.								RETR timer removed from list and
									scheduled for execution
	1. 200/BYE received->
	   reset RETR, put_on_wait
	2.								RETR timer executed -- too late but it does
									not hurt
	3.								WAIT handler executed

	The rule of thumb is don't touch data you put under a timer. Create data,
    put them under a timer, and let them live until they are safely destroyed from
    wait/delete timer.  The only safe place to manipulate the data is 
    from timer process in which delayed timers cannot hit (all timers are
    processed sequentially).

	A "bad example" -- rewriting content of retransmission buffer
	in an unprotected way is bad because a delayed retransmission timer might 
	hit. Thats why our reply retransmission procedure is enclosed in 
	a REPLY_LOCK.

/*
 * History:
 * --------
 *  2003-06-27  timers are not unlinked if timerlist is 0 (andrei)
 *  2004-02-13  t->is_invite, t->local, t->noisy_ctimer replaced;
 *              timer_link.payload removed (bogdan)
 *  2005-10-03  almost completely rewritten to use the new timers (andrei)
 *  2005-12-12  on final response marked the rb as removed to avoid deleting
 *              it from the timer handle; timer_allow_del()  (andrei)
 *  2006-08-11  final_response_handler dns failover support for timeout-ed
 *              invites (andrei)
 *  2006-09-28  removed the 480 on fr_inv_timeout reply: on timeout always 
 *               return a 408
 *              set the corresponding "faked" failure route sip_msg->msg_flags 
 *               on timeout or if the branch received a reply (andrei)
