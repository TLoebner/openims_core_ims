2006-12-14
	* removed CDATA wrapping of XML documents in XMLRPC output

2006-12-01
	* allowed standalone documentation generation - bibliograpy appended in
	this case

2006-07-12
	* improved dialog refreshing

2006-05-26
	* removed unused xcap_root parameter

2006-05-25
	* added Max-Forwards header into NOTIFY requests

2006-05-15
	* handling responses on NOTIFY
	* added parameter ignore_408_on_notify

2006-04-21
	* added parameter expiration_timer_period (timer interval for checking
	expirations)

2006-04-20
	* rls_trace function puts XML datafile in CDATA section
	* rls_trace doesn't put empty strings as separators (more readable using
	new serctl)
	* rls_trace has optional number argument - if nonzero it displays stored
	status documents
	* added parameter max_list_nesting_level for control over nested list
	processing

2006-04-18
	* added profiling

2006-04-13
	* modified optimizations of sent notifications, added parameter
	max_notifications_at_once

2006-04-11
	* changed QSA (reduced memory allocations)

2006-04-10
	* changed QSA - corrected content-type propagation

2006-04-06
	* xcap queries moved into xcap module

2006-04-04
	* sending empty string in NOTIFY bodies - TCP requires content-length and
	if sending message with NULL body, it is not set

2006-04-03
	* using function from common libraries for server contact extraction
	* RLMI document contains always fullState="true"

2006-03-24
	* removed parameter 'mode' from code (it was not needed due to explicit xcap query
	needs before resource list subscription. There is query functions for
	simplified usage: query_resource_list)

2006-03-22
	* corrected memory leak
	* reduced sent NOTIFY request count

2006-03-21
	* accepts subscription status through QSA

2006-03-20
	* multiple message queues (one for each virtual subscription) replaced by
	only one message queue for QSA notifications shared by all virtual
	subscriptions
	* xcap_root for resource list subscription stored into database (needed
	for subscription recreation)
	* notification is not propagated if document and content type didn't
	change (non-internal subscriptions only) -> reduced count of NOTIFY
	messages to the subscriber

2006-03-17
	* changed parameters of XCAP queries

2006-03-16
	* internal RLS subscriptions rewritten (i.e. nested lists handling)
	* added xcap_root and xcap_params into rl_subscription structure (needed
	for requeries, future XCAP notifications, ...)

2006-03-15
	* removed parameter "mode" (now is query done before handle_subscription
	function and nested subscriptions can not be handled as "simple"
	subscriptions
	* added functions query_rls_services, query_resource_list, have_flat_list

2006-03-07
	* corrected BUG - improper adding virtual subscriptions into list

2006-02-28
	* corrected BUG - one shot timer used for DB initialization was not in
	shared memory

2006-02-27
	* corrected BUGs - mostly used dstr_get_str instead of dstr_get_data
	because there were some cases when was allocated memory buffers of zero
	length (this consumes memory using shm_malloc), but this memory was NOT
	freed then

2006-02-16
	* removed parts of code prepared for doing "remote" subscriptions - all is
	solved using internal (QSA) subscriptions now (to PA or PRESENCE_B2B or
	RLS itself)
	* UID used instead of username when mode=simple (i.e. "simple" list URIs
	have to be in the form sip:<uid>-list@domain.com)
	* reduced trace messages

2006-02-14
	* separated B2B UA for presence into standalone module presence_b2b
