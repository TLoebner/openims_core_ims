<para>Sometimes it is needed to solve problems with presence related stuff...
;-)</para>

<section><title>Known problems</title>
<para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>AVPs might not work properly with presence. If you create
	AVPs they can disappear after call to handle_subscription or similar
	function. The reason is that from such functions is created new transaction
	(sent a NOTIFY request) and AVPs are not returned correctly to previous
	one.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>There are some standard
	incompliances in presence modules, often caused by standard ambiguity
	or contradiction or by partial implementation only. Please refer to specific
	module documentation in such situations.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>SIP clients often use broken data, not corresponding with
	data format specification. Look into specification in such cases (for
	example <xref linkend="pres_rfc_pidf"/>).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>Reporting problems</title>
<para>If you can not find the source of your problem or if you are not sure how
to do this or that, you can: 
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Try to search for similar problem in mailing lists on
	<ulink url="http://www.iptel.org/listsearch">iptel's page</ulink> or in
	<ulink url="http://lists.iptel.org/">list archives</ulink>.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Send and email to <ulink
	url="mailto:serusers@lists.iptel.org">serusers@lists.iptel.org</ulink> for
	user related problem or
	<ulink url="mailto:serdev@lists.iptel.org">serdev@lists.iptel.org</ulink>
	for development related things. There are lots of interesting people on
	these lists with
	lots of experiences with SIP related stuff ;-).
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>For presence-only related things you can send me an email
	directly to vaclav.kubart@iptel.org, but I highly prefer to use one of
	mailing lists above because many people may be interested in the same
	problem you have.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>If you find a bug, please report it to our <ulink
url="http://tracker.iptel.org/browse/SER">bug tracker</ulink>
or send an email to lists mentioned above or directly to me (email above).</para>

</section>

<section><title>New features</title>
<para>There is a list of features to be implemented in my TODO list. I will put them
into our bug tracker as soon as I will have more time for it. ;-)
</para>

<para>If you are interested in a feature you can search or ask in mailing lists
or you can add your feature into bug tracker and might be that it will be
implemented or at least discussed.
</para>
</section> <!-- new features -->

<section><title>Searching a problem</title>
<para>Most of presence modules have <quote>trace</quote> method which can be
invoked through SER's XML-RPC interface. Such method often dumps current status,
existing subscriptions etc.
</para>

<para>For calling XML-RPC methods you can simply use set of
<application>ser_ctl</application> utilities (don't mess with deprecated serctl
utility which is from unknown reason still installed with SER) or
<application>binrpc</application> which uses more effective binary
protocol.</para>
