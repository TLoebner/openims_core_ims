 * Authorization Session support is now integrated. For Accounting Sessions there is for now no state machine
 * defined, although the generic session support could be easily extended in the future if this would be required.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * \section cdp_overview Overview
 * This module is supposed to allow efficient Diameter communication to and from
 * SER. Some parts of the diameter codec are inherited from DISC 
 * http://developer.berlios.de/projects/disc/ . 
 * 
 * 
 * A series of processes are forked:
 * - 1 x Timer - timer.c
 * - 1 x Acceptor - acceptor.c
 * - k x Worker - worker.c (k configurable)   
 * - p x Receiver - receiver.c - one for each initially configured peers
 * - 1 x Receiver - receiver.c - one receiver for all other unknown peers
 * 
 * Due to sip-router restrictions, all processes must be forked at the start-up, without dynamic ones.
 * The initial cdp architecture, which assigned one process for each peer, has been modified:
 * - there are dedicated receiver processes for each initially configured peers. Each peer should be then initially
 * configured as to obtain the best performance, or none if the minimum number of processes are to be obtained
 * - there is one special receiver process for handling all the unknown peers
 * - on incoming connections, the accept process passed the TCP socket descriptor to the special receiver (as the 
 * peer identity is unknown before the CER)
 * - after CER, if the peer is not dynamic, the special receiver passes once again the TCP socket descriptor to the
 * dedicated receiver if one exists
 * - on outgoing connections, the timer makes the connection and then passes it to the respective receiver process 
 * assigned to that process or to the special receiver if the peer does not have a dedicated receiver.
 * 
 * \section cdp_realm_routing Realm Routing
 * Realm routing is integrated - see the example configuration file for a simple usage example.
 * 
 * For proper routing of Diameter requests, if a specific destination peer is to be targeted, the application
 * should add a Destination-Host AVP. Then the message will be routed directly there, if that peer is connected.
 * 
 * Otherwise, if the destination peer is not previously discovered, a Destination Realm must be filled, which will
 * trigger the use of specific Realm routes. Then the application should include an Auth/Acct-Application-Id AVP 
 * or a Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP. The stack will search then in the list of connected peers for one that
 * supports that. The support list is composed of what the peers are declaring at connection, during the 
 * capabilities exchange operations. Keep in mind that not only the Application-Id, but also the Vendor-Id (or 0 in
 * case none is defined) are taken into account.
 * 
 * The most often issue of messages not being routed is the lack of the Application-Id indicating AVP as presented
 * above, or a misconfiguration of supported applications on the other peer.   
 * 
 * 
 * \section cdp_code Code Structure
 * The SER module exported API can be seen in mod.c. The full Diameter API is in diameter.h
 * and diameter_api.h. IMS specific constants and assigned numbers are defined in 
 * diameter_ims.h. 
 * 
 * The protocol codec is implemented into diameter_avp.c and diameter_msg.c. 
 * The Diameter base protocol state machine is implemented in peerstatemachine.c. 
 * peermanager.c takes care of peer administration. Basic transactions are defined in 
 * transaction.c.   
 * 
 * \section cdp_config Configuration and Usage
 * For exported functions look at #cdp_cmds.\n
 * For configuration parameters look at #cdp_params.\n 
 * 
 * For input configuration file, take a look at configdtd.h for the structure. Here we have
 * an example (not really usable, but you should be able to derive your own):
