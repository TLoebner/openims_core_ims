 * 
 * \section thig_overview Overview
 * As SIP is a text based protocol all information is sent as plain text.
 * Some headers contain sensitive information such as the addresses of
 * entities from the home network or the number of such entities.
 * Therefore, an operator may choose to hide this information in order to
 * minimize the risk of attacks and to be able to perform changes to the internal 
 * network at will.
 * 
 * The headers in question here are : Via, Path, Record-Route and Service-Route.
 * 
 * The solution is to encrypt the headers as they leave the network and
 * to decrypt the messages when they enter the internal network.
 *
 * The Twofish encryption algorithm has been chosen for this purpose because of
 * its speed and flexibility. However, if you consider it necessary you can 
 * use some other algorithm as the interface of the application allows such 
 * changes to be performed with relative ease.
 * 
 * \section thig_code Code Structure
 * 
 * The file thig_ims_enc.c provides the following functionality:
 * 
 * 1.Initialization of the data structures needed by Twofish\n
 * 2.Ability to encrypt a SER string (also adds padding in order to 
 * perform encryption, and performs BASE64 encoding in order to use 
 * only characters that do not confuse the SIP parsers).\n
 * 3.Ability to decrypt a SER string (this removes the padding 
 * and decodes the previously BASE64 encoded string\n
 * 
 * Note: 
 * You may choose not to use the BASE64 encoding as this adds to the 
 * length of the SIP message.However be aware that doing so will result
 * in incorrect parsing of the message as the ouput from the encryption 
 * algorithm can contain any character, including the ones used by the
 * parser to delimit the parts of the message.If you choose to modify 
 * the parser accordingly, then the BASE64 encoding may indeed be
 * superfluous.
 * 
 * If you choose to use another algorithm here you can call its own 
 * block encryption functions.
 * 
 * The file thig.c contains functions necessary to add the ICSCFs address
 * to the SIP headers and also the functions that you can call to encrypt
 * or decrypt headers.
 *   
 * 
 * \section thig_config Configuration and Usage
 * You may choose to tweak the following parameters :
 * 
 * in thig_ims_enc.c: \n
 * keySize - the Twofish key length.256 bits it's the biggest value and also provides the
 * 			  most security.If you choose to use a shorter key this can improve speed
 *            but also provide less security.\n
 * mode    - the mode in which Twofish operates.MODE_EBC is not recommended as it yields
 *  		  obvious patterns in the encrypted strings and makes them prone to attacks 
 * 			  or decyphering.
 * 
 * in  thig_aes.h: \n
 * BLOCK_SIZE - number of bits per block (Twofish encrypts blocks of data) \n
 * MAX_BLK_CNT - max nr blocks per call in Twofish\n
 * 
 * You should be aware that a big value of the BLOCK_SIZE can lead to unnecessary
 * padding being added to a SIPMessage (for Example if the BLOCK_SIZE converted into
 * bytes is 16 a block of 2bytes will have to be padded with 14bytes to be encrypted).
 * 
 * Usage: \n
 * In provide thig functionality the functions from thig.c should be used.\n
 * I_THIG_encrypt_header and I_THIG_decrypt_header take as parameters the SIP message 
 * and the name of the header.Using this name the function searches for the header
 * in the messages and then encrypts the information.
 * However if you are not concerned with the details of each header then you should use
 * I_THIG_encrypt_all_headers and I_THIG_decrypt_all_headers. Those functions try
 * to encrypt/ decrypt all sensitive headers (Via, Route , Record-Route,Service-Route)
 * 
 *
