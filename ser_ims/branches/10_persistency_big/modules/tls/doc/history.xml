			This module was put together by Jan Janak <email>jan@iptel.org</email> from code  from the experimental tls core addon (<ulink url="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/experimental/tls/">http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/experimental/tls/</ulink>), code originally written by Peter Griffiths and later maintained by Cesc Santasusana and from an iptelorg tls code addon, written by Andrei Pelinescu-Onciul <email>andrei@iptel.org</email>. Jan also added support for multiple domains, a tls specific config, config reloading and a tls specific select framework.
