Documentation for Open IMS Core Java Diameter Peer library

<h1>Overview</h1>
The JavaDiameterPeer, like its counterpart CDiamterPeer, is a smart and an 
efficient Java implementation of the Diameter Base Protocol (IETF RFC3588). 
It provides a convenient way to use  Diameter stack in a Java environment and 
can easily extend network nodes implemented in Java with a Diameter interface. 
It is used at the HSS (FhoSS) in the Open IMS core network.

<h1>Design and Implementation</h1>
The following figure depicts the structure of the JavaDiameterPeer.

<p>
A DiameterPeer represents a Diameter node which implements the Diameter protocol 
and acts either as a Client or as a Server. The most important component of a 
DiameterPeer is a PeerManager. The PeerManager manages a set of Peers. Each Peer 
has a Communicator, which maintains a Diameter connection. The Peer is 
implemented based on the RFC 3588, section 5 and contains a state machine 
defined in that part. Peers managed by the PeerManager can be configured by a 
configuration file. They can also be detected and added to the PeerManager in 
runtime dynamically.

<p>
Since a DiameterPeer is listening to certain ports by using a set of Acceptors, 
the incoming Diameter Capabilities-Exchange-Request messages can be noticed. 
Upon receiving such a request, a new Peer with a communicator will be created 
and added to the PeerManager.

<p>
Outgoing Diameter messages and incoming Diameter messages are handled by the 
JavaDiameterPeer differently. For an outgoing Diameter request, JavaDiameterPeer 
sends this message to the PeerManager directly. The PeerManager will find out a 
suitable Peer for sending it.

<p>
An incoming Diameter message received by a communicator is pushed in a TaskQueue at 
first. This TaskQueue is a FIFO blocking queue. As soon as the message is 
available in the queue, a worker will take it out of the queue and deliver it to 
a set of event listeners defined by the user.

<p>
Typically, a Diameter client sends a Diameter message to a Diameter server 
directly and receives a Diameter answer by adapting an EventListener. A Diameter 
server, however, defines only an EventListener to process incoming Diameter 
request.

<p>
In order to provide a convenient way to handle Diameter request and answer at 
the client side, a TransactionWorker is defined. A TransactionWorker groups a 
request with its corresponding answer. By using TransactionWorker, a user does not
need to take care of mapping requests with answers. 

<h1>Peer Configuration</h1>
DiameterPeer.xml provides an example of how a Diameter peer is configured.
<pre>
&lt;xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;DiameterPeer 
	FQDN="localhost"
	Realm="open-ims.org"
	Vendor_Id="10415"
	Product_Name="JavaDiameterPeer"
	AcceptUnknownPeers="1"
	DropUnknownOnDisconnect="1"
	Tc="10"
	Workers="8"
	QueueLength="32"
&gt;
	&lt;Acceptor port="3868" bind="127.0.0.1" /&gt;
	
	&lt;Auth id="16777216" vendor="10415"/&gt;
	&lt;Auth id="16777216" vendor="0" /&gt;
	&lt;Acct id="16777216" vendor="0" /&gt;
	
	&lt;Realm name="my.open-ims.test"&gt;
	  &lt;Route FQDN="my1.open-ims.test" metric="2"/&gt;
	  &lt;Route FQDN="my2.open-ims.test" metric="3"/&gt;
    &lt;/Realm&gt;
    &lt;Realm name="test.open-ims.test"&gt;
  	  &lt;Route FQDN="test1.open-ims.test" metric="7"/&gt;
    &lt;/Realm&gt;
    &lt;DefaultRoute FQDN="default1.open-ims.test" metric="15"/&gt;
    &lt;DefaultRoute FQDN="default2.open-ims.test" metric="13"/&gt;
	
&lt;/DiameterPeer&gt;
</pre>

<h1>To do</h1>
Currently, the JavaDiameterPeer supports only peer connection. 
The authentication/authorization portion and accounting portion as defined in 
the Diameter base protocol (IFC 3588 section 8, 9) are still not implemented, 
since Cx, Sh do not require user session support actually. However, auth and 
acct session support are needed to realize Ro interface (auth session) and Rf 
(acct session) interface.

Realm routing is supported. For each realm, a list of hosts to be contacted
can be specified in the configuration file. Each host would have an attached
metric, with lower values being the preferred ones. For a request without a 
realm explicitly defined, the default routes will be used, also with multiple
possible entries ordered by metrics. A message will be sent to a peer only if
a connection is active and if that peer supports the required application 
ids, as declared during capabilities exchange.

  <dd>It has to be noted that this 
      <font color=red><b> Open Source IMS Core System is not intended to become 
      or act as a product in a commercial context!</b></font> Its sole purpose 
      is to provide an IMS core reference implementation for IMS technology 
      testing and IMS application prototyping for research purposes, typically 
      performed in IMS test-beds.
      <p>
      Users of the Open Source IMS Core System have to be aware that IMS 
      technology may be subject of patents and license terms, as being specified 
      within the various IMS-related IETF, ITU-T, ETSI, and 3GPP standards. Thus 
      all Open IMS Core users have to take notice of this fact and have to agree 
      to check out carefully before installing, using and extending the Open 
      Source IMS Core System, if related patents and licenses may become 
      applicable to the intended usage context.
