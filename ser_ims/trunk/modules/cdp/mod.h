 * 
 * \section cdp_overview Overview
 * This module is supposed to allow efficient Diameter communication to and from
 * SER. Some parts of the diameter codec are inherited from DISC 
 * http://developer.berlios.de/projects/disc/ . 
 * 
 * 
 * A series of processes are forked:
 * - 1 x Timer - timer.c
 * - 1 x Acceptor - acceptor.c
 * - k x Worker - worker.c (k configurable)   
 * - i x Receiver - receiver.c - one for each incoming or outgoing peer
 * 
 * \section cdp_code Code Structure
 * The SER module exported API can be seen in mod.c. The full Diameter API is in diameter.h
 * and diameter_api.h. IMS specific constants and assigned numbers are defined in 
 * diameter_ims.h. 
 * 
 * The protocol codec is implemented into diameter_avp.c and diameter_msg.c. 
 * The Diameter base protocol state machine is implemented in peerstatemachine.c. 
 * peermanager.c takes care of peer administration. Basic transactions are defined in 
 * transaction.c.   
 * 
 * \section cdp_config Configuration and Usage
 * For exported functions look at #cdp_cmds.\n
 * For configuration parameters look at #cdp_params.\n 
 * 
 * For input configuration file, take a look at configdtd.h for the structure. Here we have
 * an example (not really usable, but you should be able to derive your own):
